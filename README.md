# Finish Checker

## Description
Spraying nitrocellulose finishes for guitar building requires humidity levels to be less than 65%. This application allows a user to select their hometown and enter their zip code, after which the application will tell them the humidity in their town, and whether or not itâ€™s advisable for them to spray the finish.

Finish Checker is a responsive application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses weather data from the Open Weather API. The functionality includes form validation to ensure that the user has filled out the form correctly.
